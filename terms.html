    <p>Terms of Service</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h1>Welcome to Remocat</h1>
    <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>Remocat</strong>, an advanced security application designed to protect your devices and personal data through facial recognition authentication. These <strong>Terms of Service</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "Terms") govern the use of the Remocat app and its associated services. By using the app, you agree to comply with all the terms and conditions set forth. We encourage you to read these Terms carefully before starting to use Remocat. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>Access and use of the Remocat app are subject to these Terms. If you use the app, you automatically agree to comply with all the terms outlined. These Terms may be modified at any time without notice, and the latest version will always be available within the app itself. Your continued use of the app after any updates signifies your acceptance of the changes.</p>

    <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
    <p>Remocat is a mobile application that provides advanced facial recognition authentication features. With Remocat, you can secure your devices and sensitive content with a facial recognition unlocking system designed to offer the highest level of security.</p>
    <p>The app functions as a secure authentication method for mobile devices, protecting access to sensitive features via facial biometric recognition. No password is required, meaning that only you, and your face, will have access to what you wish to protect.</p>
    <p>Remocat also integrates an advanced facial recognition module based on TensorFlow Lite, a machine learning technology that runs locally on the device. This system allows the app to compare the face of the person unlocking the device with a registered facial model of the authorized user in real time. This makes it possible to automatically detect unauthorized access. The process is completely offline: no biometric data is transmitted or stored on external servers.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of the App</h2>
    <p>To use Remocat, you must install it on a compatible device. The app requires access to the device’s camera to capture the facial images necessary for recognition. Once set up, Remocat will store biometric data locally on the device for authentication purposes.</p>
    <p>The app should only be used for lawful purposes and not for any illegal or unauthorized activities. You agree not to attempt to bypass the security systems of the app, nor to use the app for any harmful, fraudulent activities, or that infringe on the privacy of others.</p>

    <h2>4. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Data Collection</h3>
    <p>Remocat collects and stores biometric data, including facial patterns, which are necessary for authentication. This data is collected solely to ensure the security and reliability of the facial unlocking service. It is important to note that all biometric data is stored <strong>locally</strong> on the device and <strong>never transmitted</strong> to external servers. Your privacy and the security of your data are our top priorities.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Data Usage</h3>
    <p>Biometric data is used only for authentication purposes and not for any other reason. It is not shared with third parties nor used for marketing or profiling purposes. Additionally, biometric data is stored only for as long as necessary for the functionality of the app and is protected by appropriate security measures.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Data Protection</h3>
    <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect the data we collect from unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction. However, we cannot guarantee absolute protection against all cyber threats, and we encourage you to take necessary precautions to protect your devices and data.</p>

    <h2>5. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>If you use Remocat, you are responsible for ensuring that the device on which you have installed the app is secure and protected. You are also responsible for keeping your device up-to-date with the latest security patches. Additionally, you must take all necessary precautions to ensure that no one else can use your device to access your data.</p>
    <p>In the event of loss or theft of the device, it is your responsibility to immediately disable access to Remocat by contacting support or using the security options provided within the app. We recommend regularly monitoring your device’s access to detect any suspicious activity.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Remocat shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or other damages arising from the use or malfunction of the app, including but not limited to device damage, data loss, financial loss, or privacy violations.</p>
    <p>Although the app is designed to protect your data with the highest level of security, we cannot guarantee that the facial recognition system will always be infallible or error-free. In the event of a malfunction, you can still access your devices using other unlocking methods provided by the device’s operating
